# adventofcode

My submissions to advent of code through the years.

# Disclaimer

I might not be the best of programmers, which is why I specify in every solution whether I actually solved it by myself or if I had any kind of "inspiration".
Inspiration could be anything from getting a pointer towards what to do, or just rewriting someone elses solution in a manner that makes me understand it.

I am in no way trying to participate in any kind of competition, I'm just trying to improve as a programmer.

Take care :))))
